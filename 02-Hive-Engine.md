# 🐝 Hive: SQL / Data Warehouse Layer on Hadoop

Hive is a **SQL and data warehouse (DWH) layer** built on top of the Hadoop ecosystem.  
- Uses **HDFS** for storage.
- Uses execution engines like **MapReduce (MR), Tez, or Spark** for distributed processing.
- Relies on an external database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for its **Metastore**, which keeps metadata about tables, columns, partitions, etc.

## ⚙️ What happens in the background when you run a Hive query?

When you write and submit a query in Hive, it undergoes multiple internal steps:

1. **Parsing**  
   - a. Syntax check (valid HiveQL)
   - b. Semantic check (logical correctness, e.g., column existence)

2. **Binding**  
   - a. Add required parameters to the query (e.g., default database context)

3. **Metadata Enrichment**  
   - a. Validate the existence of tables, columns, partitions
   - b. Fetch schema details like column names, datatypes, and storage formats from the Metastore

4. **Query Optimization**  
   - a. Generate an optimized logical and physical execution plan
   - b. Apply rule-based and cost-based optimizations (e.g., predicate pushdown, join reordering)

5. **Query Execution**  
   - a. Pass the optimized execution plan to the chosen engine (MR/Tez/Spark)
   - b. Engine translates the plan into low-level jobs written in Java/Scala/Python and executes them across the cluster

> ✅ **Note:**  
> These steps are common in distributed SQL engines, but Hive's modular design lets you change the execution engine without changing your SQL.

## 🌟 Capabilities of Hive

1. **Build Lakehouse on top of a Datalake**  
   - Works with scalable filesystems like HDFS, S3, GCS, ADLS, or Blob storage.

2. **Supports both ELT & ETL**  
   - ELT: Load raw data first, then transform.
   - ETL: Transform before loading into final curated tables.

3. **Designed for high throughput workloads**  
   - Ideal for batch processing and large-scale historical analytics.
   - Not optimized for low-latency, row-level transactional workloads.

4. **Flexible parsing, cleansing, and transformation**  
   - Can parse and transform data at load time or query time.

5. **Supports iterative workloads**  
   - Refine transformations, create new derived tables, and repeat until the output meets business requirements.

6. **Partial ACID compliance**  
   - Supports basic transactions (INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE) in transactional tables (using ORC format and Hive 3.x+).
   - Does **not** fully support complex transactional logic or TCL like traditional OLTP databases.

7. **Handles both structured and semi-structured data**  
   - Supports formats like Parquet, ORC, Avro, JSON, XML.

8. **Excellent for historical analytics on large datasets**  
   - Great for time-based analysis, trend reports, and BI dashboards.

✅ **In summary:**  
Hive is a powerful SQL layer that makes it easy to process and analyze big data in Hadoop and modern cloud storage systems.  
Its design supports large-scale, schema-flexible, and iterative analytics — perfect for data engineers and analysts working on big data.
